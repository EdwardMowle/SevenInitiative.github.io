            <h1>What does "Seven Initiative" even mean?</h1>
            <p>Initially, nothing at all. Like many nerds turned professional we default to an old gamer tag or the domain we registered for that great idea we had but never followed through on. That was pretty much the case with Seven Intiative. I do remember choosing those words for a couple reasons though. <strong>Seven</strong> is a number related to perfection and I am certainly perfectionist in life and in work (I write clean code). <strong>Initiative</strong>, because it is the virtue that I most admire in others and have worked the hardest to cultivate for myself. In a way, <strong>Seven Initiative</strong> describes my ethos: the purposeful pursuit of perfection. Also, the ".com" address was available.</p>
