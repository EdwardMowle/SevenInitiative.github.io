        <p class="Greeting">Hi, I'm Edward.</p>
        <p class="Intro">
            I'm a software consultant who specialises in JavaScript app development and building great
            user experiences. I have a passion for agile principles and finding ways to increase productivity, learn
            rapidly and improve customer experiences. I also have experience establishing inner source projects that
            enable teams to standardise and share code across a business.

                I have used or played with other languages or frameworks in the past but here is a list of the
                technical
                stack I'm using right now. I definitely specialise in front-end web technologies but am not averse to
                with working on back-end services and doing devops type jobs. I'm also a hobbyist game developer.

            <h2>My passion project for writers</h2>
            <p>
                I am the founder and lead developer of <a href="https://storydock.io">Storydock</a>. A few years ago
                I committed myself to realising a childhood dream of becoming a published fiction writer. As I learnt
                about how to write and structure fiction from books, courses and seminars I realised so much of this
                wisdom could be embedded in an application that would give fiction writers the kinds of features that I
                had taken for granted, as a coder, when using my favourite IDE (code editor). I couldn't find it, so I
                built it.</p>
            <p>
                Storydock helps it's users to organise their notes, create their cast of characters, structure their
                plot (no matter how complex), write their novel with automatic hints to aid readability or link to
                their notes, and ultimately publish it to an online audience. </p>

            <h2>My productivity app for life hackers</h2>
            <p>
                I'm also the creator of a mobile app called <a href="https://getswarm.com">Swarm</a>. Swarm is an
                innovative habit tracker with addictive gamification and community features. The
                accountability and competition that the app provides spurs it's users on to become the more
                disciplined, productive and ambitious versions of themselves they want to be.</p>
